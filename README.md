Diabetes Prediction Model

The Diabetes Prediction project involves creating a machine learning model to diagnose diabetes based on a dataset containing various health metrics. This project utilizes a diabetic dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of 9 columns and 800 rows. The goal is to accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes.

Key Steps and Achievements: Data Cleaning:

The dataset underwent rigorous data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step ensured the quality and reliability of the data for further analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of the data, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between different features. Visualizations and statistical measures were used to gain insights into the data. Model Fitting:

Implemented three different machine learning algorithms to build predictive models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm. Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification. Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction. Parameter Optimization:

Utilized Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model parameters. This step involved systematically testing different combinations of parameters to find the best-performing model. Model Performance:

The optimized models were evaluated for their accuracy in diagnosing diabetes. The best model achieved an accuracy of 75%, indicating a reliable prediction capability. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in the medical field, particularly for the prediction of diabetes. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model optimization in building effective predictive models.
